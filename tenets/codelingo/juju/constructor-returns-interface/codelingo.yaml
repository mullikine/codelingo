        title: Constructor Returns Interface
        body: |
          If you see a constructor that returns an interface instead of a concrete
          type, it's almost certainly wrong.
      codelingo/review:
        comment: This constructor returns an interface instead of a concrete type. This is probably not what you want to do.
